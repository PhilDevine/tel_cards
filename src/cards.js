        description: "The first in a new series of lunch events “MEET & EAT” was successfully held on 24 October 2017. 16 of us met and discussed with Professor Thomas Ryberg about his recent article Understanding Nomadic Collaborative Learning Groups. We ate freshly wrapped burritos together and digested new ideas of how groups of students move back and forth between digital and physical spaces through creatively incorporating digital/non-digital technologies into their group work. Why don’t you come along next time?",
